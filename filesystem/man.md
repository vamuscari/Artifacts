# Finding system information

Information about the general system can be found by `man`, `apropos`, or `whatis`.

```{bash}
man man
```

To enable color add the following to the zshrc or bashrc.
```{bash}
export MANCOLOR=true
```
I added to .zshenv for clarity of scope


modify */etc/man.conf* for system wide change
