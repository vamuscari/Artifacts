# Artifacts
This was created out of having directories for both documentation, scripts, and configurations independently. Often they go hand-in-hand and separating them doesn't make sense. How tmux interacts with neovim or zsh(just one of many examples) is important and the documentation shouldn't be scattered across my file system. This is not a singular project per say, but a collection of information on my developer workflow. 

This repo was made for personal use but feel free to look or copy.
